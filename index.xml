      <description>Braeden Conrad (bsc875)  Understanding the Value of NBA Players through History Introduction I was able to find two data sets by using Python to scrape from basketballreference and HoopsHype. The first data set is all of the advanced statistics for every player since 1990. The second data set is all of the salaries for those players since 1990. In combining these two data sets, we hope to identify the best and worst value players/teams and trends since 1990.</description>
